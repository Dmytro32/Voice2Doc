Developed a speech-to-text application leveraging the Whisper model via Hugging Face, with both desktop and web-based implementations.

Audio Capture & Preprocessing: Implemented microphone input and audio handling using PyAudio, Sounddevice, and Wave libraries to reliably record and prepare audio data for transcription.

Speech Recognition: Integrated Whisper to automatically transcribe voice input into text with high accuracy.

GUI Implementation: Built a Tkinter desktop interface with the ability to save transcriptions directly into a .doc file.

Web Application: Designed a Flask-based web version to provide browser-based transcription functionality.

Usability: Focused on making speech recognition accessible through simple, user-friendly interfaces.
